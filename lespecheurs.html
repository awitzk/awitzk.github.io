							<h3> I worked with the NYC-based studio as a design engineer in the early concept and development stage of this art installation.</h3>
							<p class="major">
							My role was to design Les Pêcheurs's fish, and the fixtures that would let them swing with the wind, based on a general shape of the sculpture body.<br>I built a schedule for the project by turning customer requirements into design decisions that factored in budgeting, man-power and delivery times.
							<br>Then, I designed the actual components in an iterative fashion using Fusion360 and ensured structural
							capability with FEA analysis. As the concept became more concrete, I prioritized design for manufacturing and assembly for the 500+ units needed.
							<br> Finally, I requested quotes from local suppliers and evaluated them in a dialogue that involved a variety of manufacturing methods and opportunities for cost reduction. This material was then handed over to the studio so they could carry on the work.</p>

										<h3>Initial Fish Concepts</h3>
										<p>In the first version, the fish where round as the customer had indicated. During discussions, this later chaged to a less abstract shape.</p>

										<h3>Fish size to cost relation</h3>
										<p>With a known area to cover, the size (and spacing) of the fish affected the amount required, and in turn, this was linked to the cost.</p>

										<h3>Delivered Fixture</h3>
										<p>The last version of the fixture I delivered provided the additional support without adding to the number of parts. It was designed to be cut flat and then bent during assembly to minimize manufacturing and transport costs.</p>

										<p>With a more concrete shape, I model three sizes of fish to be considered adjusting for the budget or any changes. These were sent to suppliers for quotes and lead times.</p>
